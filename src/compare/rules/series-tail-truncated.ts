/**
 * SERIES_TAIL_TRUNCATED — one source stops before the other does.
 *
 * Counting shared sessions hides this case: if the overlap is long enough,
 * INSUFFICIENT_OVERLAP stays silent, and BAR_MISSING only sees gaps BETWEEN
 * bars, so a series that is simply cut short at its end has none. The
 * comparison then reports agreement while one feed is missing the most recent
 * sessions the other one has, which is usually the data a caller wanted.
 *
 * Only the tail is judged. A different START date is normal (vendors serve
 * different history lengths) and is not a finding. The default threshold is
 * two sessions, so a feed that has not yet published today's bar is not
 * reported. The case was reported in issue #35, from a regression where two
 * authority dates absent from the subject still produced a PASS.
